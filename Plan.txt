Questions to Jorge
1. Should the diver not be able to collision with fish? In reality if fish meet a diver they move around it
2. How long should a dive be? Is 1min30 too long?
3. If I make corals appear, should they appear randomly and be avoided? or only on the sea bottom?
4. Should fish have different speed? Should I randomize them?
5. Should I prevent "Rafagas" ? Right now the user can continuosly click the bottom (Key Z) for "take picture"
